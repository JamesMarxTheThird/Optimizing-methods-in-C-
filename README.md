# Optimizing-methods-in-C-
Simple 2 lines of C# code, calling another class containing 3 methods and loops that perform the same function. The benchmark tests all of these methods extensively and gives a final report dtating the median, mean and best times. One can use this for any similar codes to find the most optimized version, helping them develop optimized, fast software.
